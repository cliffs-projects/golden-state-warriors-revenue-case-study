## üõ†Ô∏è Background

### Focus on Growth
This case study emphasizes growth, a priority identified by the president and CEO of the franchise. The study aligns with leadership's goals, focusing on revenue due to the availability of data and the potential for actionable recommendations.

### Hypothesis
Introducing pre-packaged foods with self-pay stations will facilitate more concession purchases by removing common pain points: long queues and the pressure to tip. This strategy aims to enhance the customer experience by shortening wait times and offering cheaper products, addressing common complaints from stadium attendees.

### Personas
- **Stadium Attendees**: 
  - Goals: Reduce concession wait times and lower product costs.
- **Warriors' Executives**:
  - Goals: Improve customer experience and enhance financial KPIs.

### Methodology
Fake online retail data was sourced from platforms such as Kaggle and Google Dataset Search, simulating sales data from Golden State Warriors concession stands. This data was segmented and analyzed to derive insights.

### North Star Metrics
1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue from Concessions**: An overview of total revenue from concessions.
2. **Monthly Recurring Revenue per Payment Channel**: Breakdown of concession revenue across different payment channels.
3. **Percent Monthly Revenue Share per Payment Channel**: Percentage of total concession revenue contributed by each payment channel.

## üîç Findings

### Finding 1
The sample data suggests that quick checkout options positively impact revenue and are regularly used, contributing to 25% of monthly revenue over a two-year period, with contributions exceeding 30% approximately 45% of the time.

### Finding 2
Quick checkout concession sales experience revenue spikes in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th quarters of the year. This pattern likely correlates with key moments in the NBA season, such as season openers and playoffs, suggesting higher attendance during these periods.

## üìà Next Steps and Recommendations

1. **Controlled Testing**: Further controlled testing is necessary to determine the true efficacy of quick checkouts in a stadium setting.
  
2. **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing to assess the impact of quick checkouts. Ensure guardrail metrics are in place to validate positive results and avoid potential cannibalization of other revenue streams.
